# Detonation
### Magician's Brick
Useless. Throws a brick
### Fireball
Useless. Throws a fireball
### Crash To Desktop
Executes an illegal operation to crash the game
### ???
Uncompletable, joke description
# Altercation
### Butter Mode
Remove speed limit from levitating and all floor friction
### Dynamo
Non-stop spinning force applied to the wizard. Can probably be used for uncontrollable high jumps, will need to see if physics engine agrees.
### Become Green
If you don't use it you will be chased by a tiger in the forest. Unless I don't have time to implement that, then it's useless.
### Boing
All wizard collisions become perfectly elastic. Probably breaks the game or is useless.
# Restoration
### Levitation
Start the game with this. Need to cast to be able to move.
### NightmareVision
Does nothing
### Lose weight
Become thin. If you can manage to flip on your side, you can fit in tight space inside Sean's fortress, needed for progression
### Dispel
Remove all currently applied effects
# Simulation
### Town Portal
Return to map select screen. Probably second spell you find.
### Jubilation
Some fireworks go off to celebrate.
### Collapse Reality
The block being stood on becomes dynamic - gravity now applies to it 
### Summon Frog
Summons a dynamic frog object in the background. Can be stacked infinitely. Useless, or maybe useful for crashing the game.
